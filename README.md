## Sycamore Netlify Functions

This example shows how to deploy a [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) server with Netlify functions.

Functions can be deployed using Netlify's CLI as well as Netlify Build environment.

You can copy this repository and deploy it to Netlify by clicking the button below.

After clicking that button, youâ€™ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete.

## Build & Deployment

### Deploying with CLI

You need to install Netlify's CLI first:

```
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

Then run the following command:

```
make deploy
```

### Deploying with Netlify Build

Create a new Netlify site and link it to your repository. Netlify will detect the Rust toolchain automatically, build the code and deploy it for you.
